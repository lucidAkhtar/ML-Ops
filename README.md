# ML-Ops
This repo shows hands on knowledge with regards to the implementation of ML Ops using Open source technologies such as Ml Flow, Weights and Biases, DVC and other industry standards best practices.

The lessons are taken from Udacity ML DevOps Engineering course. These lessons teach about the Reproducibility in ML Pipelines.
My work is saved in the `starter` folder of each lesson.

I have also added comments during coding exercises.
